## Deploy the Latest Spark 2.1 on CDH

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ChicoQ/BigDataBlog/edit/master/DeploySpark2.1.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

I had followed this article [Running Spark 2.x.x on Cloudera Hadoop Distro (CDH)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/running-spark-2xx-cloudera-hadoop-distro-cdh-deenar-toraskar-cfa) and made some changes.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ChicoQ/BigDataBlog/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
